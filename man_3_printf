.TH _PRINTF 3 "December 2023" "Custom printf" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- custom formatted output conversion function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include "main.h"
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf()
function produces output according to a
.I format
string and writes it to stdout, the standard output stream.
.PP
The
.I format
string is composed of zero or more directives. Ordinary characters (not %) 
are copied unchanged to the output stream. Conversion specifications are 
introduced by the character % and end with a conversion specifier.
.PP
Between the % character and the conversion specifier, there may be zero or 
more flag characters or length modifiers that modify the behavior of the conversion.
.SH LENGTH MODIFIERS
The length modifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.B l
The argument is interpreted as a
.B long
or
.B "unsigned long"
for integer conversions.
.TP
.B h
The argument is interpreted as a
.B short
or
.B "unsigned short"
for integer conversions.
.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. 
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.B c
The
.B int
argument is converted to an
.BR "unsigned char" ,
and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
The
.B "const char *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type 
(pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to 
(but not including) a terminating null byte (\\0).
.TP
.B S
The
.B "const char *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to a string. Characters from the array 
are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte (\\0). Non 
printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed as \\x 
followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 
characters).
.TP
.B p
The
.B "void *"
argument is converted to a sequence of printable characters in hexadecimal 
format. The value is prefixed with '0x'. If the pointer is NULL, the 
string '(nil)' is printed.
.TP
.B d
The
.B int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B i
The
.B int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B b
The
.B "unsigned int"
argument is converted to binary notation.
.TP
.B u
The
.B "unsigned int"
argument is converted to unsigned decimal notation.
.TP
.B o
The
.B "unsigned int"
argument is converted to unsigned octal notation.
.TP
.B x
The
.B "unsigned int"
argument is converted to unsigned hexadecimal notation (lowercase).
.TP
.B X
The
.B "unsigned int"
argument is converted to unsigned hexadecimal notation (uppercase).
.TP
.B %
A '\%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion 
specification is '\%\%'.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, the
.B _printf()
function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null 
byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, \-1 is returned.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example demonstrates the use of
.BR _printf() :
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Long integer: %ld\\n", 123456789L);
    _printf("Short integer: %hd\\n", 12345);
    _printf("Long unsigned: %lu\\n", 4294967295UL);
    _printf("Short unsigned: %hu\\n", 65535);
    return (0);
}
